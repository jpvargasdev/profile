## Why I Did This

The goal was simple: **Test my knowledge of Data Science and ML after my first month of study**, and then write a blog post to share what I learned.

A bunch of libraries, a bunch of black-boxes, lot of frameworks, raw logic, math, and curiosity.

---

## Why?

Because I wanted to test my knowledge, **apply the concepts**, and start doing some "real work", move data through layers with `model.fit()`.

---

## Tools I Used

- **Python** for running the final notebook
- **Kaggle** to document everything in one place
- **sckit-learn** ML learning library, a bunch of tools
- **pandas, patblotlib, seaborn, numpy** Bunch of tools for python, to manage arrays, graphs
- **Bunch of Models to do .fit()** XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor (My favourite), etc

---

## The Biggest Challenge

Honestly, **finding features** was the hardest part, learning the concepts and applying was difficult as well but creating this kind of awareness and craftiness to find this hidden relations between desired output and features will take a lot of time.

I'm not going to lie, it took me many nights, lectures and videos with fancy animations to "understand" the tools and be able to know where and when should I use them.

---

## What I Built

I ended up implementing:

- A working ML model trained to predict house prices
- A comparison with many different regression models

---

## Key Result

Error: 0.12071 (In some tests I got less, like 0.11 but whatever I'm just learning)
Position in the leaderboard 361/4551 

---

## What’s Next?

I feel very happy with the result, I will start doing ML competitions time to time, I will put a goal of two competitions monthly

Now in my AI Engineer path I'm focusing on OpenCV and CNN. I want to find a competition that makes me build filters with OpenCV and a CNN using libraries and compare it with basic python code. 

---

## Why I Shared This on Kaggle

I wanted to **document the process**.  
It’s also a great way to study other machine learning techniques like:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Other classical ML models
