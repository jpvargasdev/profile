title: "I Built a Forensics Tool to Analyze Real-World Car Crashes"

excerpt: "We developed a mobile tool that reconstructs vehicle accidents using real police data, mathematical models, and on-device sensors — but the real challenge wasn’t technical."

Back in 2022, I co-authored a scientific paper published by the SAE on a project that aimed to create a mobile tool for forensic crash reconstruction in the field. The idea was simple: empower police officers with an app that uses real-time sensor data and proven physical models to reconstruct what happened in a crash.

### The Mission

The goal was to build a **mobile application** that could help investigators analyze road accidents **directly on site**. Instead of relying solely on manual methods or lab-based tools, we wanted to make accident reconstruction **accessible in the field**, instantly.

### My Role

I was responsible for:

- Programming and architecting the mobile solution
- Designing the mathematical models used for reconstruction
- Prototyping and validating results with real-world cases

We used **Android** for the mobile platform and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for backend services.

### Real Data, Real Challenges

The data came from **actual police cases**, thanks to a teammate with access to that information. We validated the models using **real crash scenarios**, not just synthetic data. And the math? Beautiful. Everything worked **on the first try**.

But the hardest part wasn’t building the tool.

### Adoption is Harder Than Engineering

The real challenge was **training police officers to use the tool**. Despite the success of the models and app, adoption failed. Some officers resisted change — due to **corruption, ego, or simply inertia**. The tool worked, but the process didn’t.

> _“Technology isn’t always the hard part. Changing minds is.”_

### Lessons Learned

This experience taught me that even well-designed tools can be rendered useless without cultural or institutional support. You can solve the math, you can code the app, but if the user isn’t ready — progress halts.

I’m not currently working in the forensics or ADAS space, but I do plan to publish again any time in the future.
