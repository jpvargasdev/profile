## Why I Did This

Two months studying ML and Data, let's continue playing with kaggle competitions.

Again I will use a bunch of scikit libraries, black boxes and Optuna to make mi score go a bit up

---

## Why?

I am trying to do between 1 or 2 competitions per month in Kaggle, it will help me to improve my knowledge in ML and Data analysis

---

## Tools I Used

- **Python** for running the final notebook
- **Kaggle** to document everything in one place
- **sckit-learn** ML learning library, a bunch of tools
- **pandas, patblotlib, seaborn, numpy** Bunch of tools for python, to manage arrays, graphs
- **XGBoost**  XGBClassifier

---

## The Biggest Challenge

This time as always the hardest part is to understand the data and try to find some relations between features.

This time the dataset was pretty clean and small, so just feature engineering. This time I skipped PCA since I still don't feel confident to implement it. Will try it in next competitions.

---

## What I Built

I ended up implementing:

- A working ML XGBoost model trained

---

## Key Result

Result: 0.97041
Position in the leaderboard 424/4551 

---

## What’s Next?

If I feel that I have time I will try to improve some feeatures and try to find more hidden relations to increase the score. Also maybe I could try different models like CatClassifier, it works with categorical data and it could reduce a lot the size of the code since I do not need to encode the categorical values.

---

## Why I Shared This on Kaggle

I wanted to **document the process**.  
It’s also a great way to study other machine learning techniques like:

- Binary Classification  
- Decision Trees  
- Other classical ML models
