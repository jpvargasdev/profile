## Why I Did This

The goal was simple: **learn neural networks by building one from scratch**, and then write a blog post to share what I learned.

No libraries, no black-box frameworksâ€”just raw logic, math, and curiosity.

---

## Why From Scratch?

Because I wanted to truly **understand the concepts**, not just move data through layers with `model.fit()`. I was tired of the *magic*. I needed to get my hands dirty.

---

## Tools I Used

- **TypeScript** for building the engine from scratch
- **Python** for running the final notebook
- **Kaggle** to document everything in one place

---

## The Biggest Challenge

Honestly, **understanding the math** behind neural networks was the hardest part.

Once I nailed that down, the code started to make sense. Internalizing the concepts was more challenging than the syntax itself.

---

## What I Built

I ended up implementing:

- A fully working **neural network engine**
- A **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- A comparison with a regular fully-connected network on the same dataset

---

## Key Result

Seeing the CNN outperform the standard network was incredible. The accuracy boost on digit recognition was **significant**, and it made the extra effort totally worth it.

---

## Whatâ€™s Next?

I built this engine just for learning purposes. But maybe Iâ€™ll reuse it.  
In fact, I already have a TypeScript repo where I train cars to drive themselves on a track:  
ðŸ”— [Self-driving cars in TS](https://github.com/jpvargasdev/cars)

This is the neural network engine repo:  
ðŸ”— [NN Engine (TypeScript)](https://github.com/jpvargasdev/NN_engine)

---

## Why I Shared This on Kaggle

I wanted to **document the process** and **start joining competitions**.  
Itâ€™s also a great way to study other machine learning techniques like:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Other classical ML models

---

Hope this inspires someone else to build from scratch at least once. Youâ€™ll learn more than you expect.
