steps:

Now lets work in DetailOverlay.tsx

	1.	Remove the top modal header
Delete the “Experience Details” bar and its divider line.
	2.	Remove the heavy container styling
Eliminate thick borders and strong shadows around the overlay.
	3.	Reduce border radius
Use subtle rounding (4–8px max) or remove it completely.
	4.	Use a centered sheet layout
Keep the overlay centered with generous margins around it. Avoid edge-to-edge modal feel.
	5.	Reduce backdrop opacity
Use a soft, subtle background dim (not dark dramatic contrast).
	6.	Simplify the close control
Replace large or prominent “X” with a small, subtle × aligned to the content width.
	7.	Remove metadata icons
Delete calendar and location icons.
	8.	Convert metadata to inline text
Format as:
Sep 2023 – Present · Stockholm, Sweden
	9.	Standardize hierarchy
Structure content as:

Role Title
Company
Metadata
